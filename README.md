##Python + Geographic Data = BFFs (best friends forever)
###A talk for PyCon 2014 and the Portland Python User Group
by Mele Sax-Barnett, *(with code contributions from @sgillies and @keturn, and some images shamelessly borrowed from around the internet)*

[The presentation is live here](http://pdxmele.com/python-geodata-bffs/index.html) (you'll need to give it a minute to load), and was created with [big](https://github.com/tmcw/big).

The markdown version of it (with extensive notes, including a lot of things I probably won't have time to say) is [here](https://github.com/pdxmele/python-geodata-bffs/blob/master/presentation.md).

Additional resources are [here](https://github.com/pdxmele/python-geodata-bffs/blob/master/resources.md), and you can find the examples in the [code_examples](https://github.com/pdxmele/python-geodata-bffs/tree/master/code_examples) folder.
